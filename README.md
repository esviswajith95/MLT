# MLT - Class notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks I prepared in [Machine Learning Techniques Course](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/course_pages/BSCCS2007.html) from [IIT Madras Online Degree Programme in Data Science and Programming](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/index.html)(Diploma Level).

The course deals with mathematical details of Machine learning algorithms as well as their implemention from scratch using basic libraries like Numpy.
